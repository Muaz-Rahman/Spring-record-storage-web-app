# Spring-record-storage-web-app
This web application is made with spring boot, utilizing spring boot web dependency and uses thymeleaf as the templating engine for displaying the web pages. Uses postgresql as the database server.
It is a web app primarily meant for me learning to use spring boot and subsequently add more functionalities to this application when I am able to implement them.
This web application was NOT made using a docker.
